# ParkingApp Task

Build a simple app that allows booking of company’s parking place (we have reserved
parking spot on a street by the office). It should be possible to book this place using a slack
command (ie. /parking book). Such booking will be valid until end of day (in correct time
zone) or until someone releases it (so an option to release booking is also required).
